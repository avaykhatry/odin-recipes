# odin-recipes
The current project is as fas as I know will talk have the links and recipes for idk what! And the skills that I will hopefully have demonstrated are basics of HTML and how to use git (a version control system) and github (a cloud-based repository for storing the versions of our projects)! I will be using git to commit my project history to this online-based repository!
